Static Comp Challenge 2
In this static comp challenge, I've attepted to recreate a replica of a landing page for what appears to be a social networking site for employment. In my iteration I've chosen to center the social media site around music,more specifically albums that impacted my early love for music. This was not done without it's challenges of alignment and movement of my "small container" which still persist, I also need to add media queries. Below I've enclosed the original and the replication of this static comp.
